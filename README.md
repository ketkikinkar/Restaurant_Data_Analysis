# Restaurant_Data_Analysis

### Introduction
Restaurant data analysis is one of the most useful analyses for foodies who want to taste the best cuisines of every part of the world which lies in their budget. This analysis is also for those who want to find the value for money restaurants in various parts of the country for the cuisines. Additionally, this analysis caters the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and which locality of that country serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants

### Motivation
It is very common that we hang out with families, friends, and coworkers when comes to lunch or dinner time. As the users of recommendation applications, people care more about how we will like a restaurant. People will tend to have happier experiences when the prediction of the recommendation system is as good as what it says. As there is a completed and big data set of user and restaurant reviews, we want to see whether we can use the latest techniques to make good predictions. In the data set, there are not only reviews but also relevant information of users and restaurants that allow us to do more complicated computation, which might lead to the construction of a better model.

### Problem Statement

In  the  past,  people  obtained  suggestions  for  restaurants  from  friends  or  other  conventional sources or sites. Although this method is straightforward and user-friendly, it has some severe limitations.  First,  the  recommendations  from  friends  or  other  common  people  are  limited  to those places they have visited before. Thus, the user is not able to gain information about places less  visited  by  their  friends.  Besides  that,  there  is  a  chance  of  users  not liking  the  place recommended by their friends. Second, the information provided by the site can often be biased; thus the information provided cannot always be considered accurate. Our primary aim is to do data visualization with the help of matplotlib and Power BI and perform operations with MapReduce. 

### Objective:
The main objectives of the application are:
- To collect user ratings on the cuisines  of different restaurants.
- To  recommend  restaurants  and  foods  to  users  based  on  their  user  ratings  using collaborative filtering algorithm.
- To check online delivery systems of different restaurants.
- Location of the restaurant is an important factor to be considered when building a restaurant recommendation system. Location will be used to filter the restaurants from a top list.
